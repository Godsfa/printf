The **0x11. C - printf** project is an implementation of the `printf` function in the C programming language. The `printf` function in C is used to print formatted output to the standard output (usually the console). This project aims to replicate the functionality of the standard `printf` while also adding some custom features.

## Features

- Supports basic format specifiers such as `%s`, `%d`, `%c`, and more.
- Handles flags, width, precision, and length modifiers.
- Supports custom format specifiers for additional functionality.
- Handles special characters and escape sequences.
- Provides error handling and return value management.

## Getting Started
